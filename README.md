### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Megan O'Rorke, a Data Scientist living in San Francisco. 

Previously Founder of AI Collective, Product Manager for a ML app at Capital One & Research Assistant @ Calit2. I have 10yrs of industry experience at tiny startups & large companies for industries including banking, e-commerce & health. After winding down my startup I'm currently consulting, most recently for a Fortune 100 biotech company.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning a bit of deep learning w/fast.ai & how to get models off my laptop with GCP & AWS
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on real-world projects, bioinformatics & ML in the cloud
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help becoming a better Python3 programmer - ping me if you're interested in pair programming!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- Fun fact: O'Reilly books are 80% of my book collection & it's my dream to someday be an author 

# What got me interested in data science? #
I got hooked on data while working at Calit2 on research projects from predicting future fires using satellite imagery to mining research publications to model a research university's expertise. I was in awe of the level of personalization possible with zero user input & how ML could literally save homes & lives. But I had very little programming experience & a large amount of student loans to pay off, so instead of going straight to grad school I went into industry & progressively took on more technical roles.

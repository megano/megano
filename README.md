### Hello there! 👋

I'm Megan O'Rorke, a Data Scientist living in San Francisco. 

Previously Founder of AI Collective, Product Manager for a restaurant recommendations ML app at Capital One & Research Assistant @ Calit2. I have 10yrs of broad industry experience in engineering, product & management roles at tiny startups & large companies like Sony & Qualcomm & Capital One across industries including banking, e-commerce & health. After winding down my startup, I'm currently consulting, most recently on an 80 person project for a Fortune 100 biotech company.

🌱 I’m learning a bit of deep learning w/fast.ai & how to get models off my laptop with GCP & AWS.
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on real-world data projects, bioinformatics & ML in the cloud.
🤔 I’m looking for help becoming a better Python3 programmer - ping me if you're interested in pair programming!
😄 Pronouns: she/her
Fun fact: O'Reilly books are 80% of my book collection & it's my dream to someday be an author. 

### What got me interested in data science? ###
Several years ago I had a job at Calit2. I did manual data labeling & cleaning on research projects from predicting future fires using satellite imagery to mining research publications to model a research university's expertise. I was in awe of the level of personalization that was possible with zero user input & how machine learning could literally save homes & lives. I was hooked. But also I had very little programming experience & a large amount of student loans to pay off, so instead of going straight to grad school I went into industry & progressively took on more technical roles.
